<p>Manage your favorite TV series and movies from your browser's new tab page
Keep track of your progress in all the series you're watching and movies you want to watch in a souped up 'new tab' page.</p>

<p>Allows you to browse through all your favorite series, view the schedule, and show series information.
On top of that, it allows you to search The Pirate Bay (and others, in the future) when an episode has aired to find magnet links leading to it.</p>

<p>It comes in 2 flavours:</p>

<ul>
<li>'New Tab mode': Installs itself as your new tab page  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hkbamkappmgfjjahmnlngibomenmbbdf/">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hkbamkappmgfjjahmnlngibomenmbbdf/</a>
</li>
<li>'Browser Action mode': Adds a button next to your address bar <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cdfkaloficjmdjbgmckaddgfcghgidei/">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cdfkaloficjmdjbgmckaddgfcghgidei/</a>
</li>
</ul><h1>
<a name="permissions" class="anchor" href="#permissions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Permissions</h1>

<p>Chrome will report that this plugin wants to access your data on all websites and read/modify your browser history.</p>

<p>The permissions are actually less scary than they look. Chrome doesn't have the granular permissions system that Android has, so labels can be confusing versus what they're actually used for.</p>

<p><strong>Access your data on all websites</strong></p>

<p>The plugin request permissions to access http://<em>.</em>/ to be able to allow any random mirror to be used for The Pirate Bay and custom trackers in the future. Chrome's extension model requires you to whitelist <em>exactly</em> the urls that you are accessing, which becomes impossible because of this.
<strong>Read and modify your browser history</strong></p>

<p>The plugin requests this to use the Chrome.Topsites API that allows to display your most favorite sites on the new tab extension. If you do not wish to give this permission, please use the 'Browser Action' version.</p>

<h1>
<a name="privacy-statement" class="anchor" href="#privacy-statement"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Privacy Statement</h1>

<p><strong>I DO NOT WANT YOUR DATA</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The only statistics tracked are the installations by google analytics and visits to the public github site.</li>
<li>As soon you install this plugin it runs locally without sending statistics anywhere. There is no logging from my side of anything you do within this plugin and there never will be.</li>
<li>I do not want your money, I do this in my spare time for fun and to make my own life and that of other's easier. There is no business model.</li>
<li>There are no costs to cover: No servers, no hosting, no databases, everything runs on google's, github's and reddit's infrastructure. Therefore you are <em>not</em> the product and this is extension is free as in free beer.</li>
<li>Everything runs locally. If you decide to execute a torrent search for an episode, a request goes from your computer to the search engine.</li>
</ul><p>Please open a github ticket or start a <a href="http://reddit.com/r/duckietv/">reddit thread</a> if there is anything else that needs improvement. And remember, this is a beta.</p>
