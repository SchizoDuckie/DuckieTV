# DuckieTV ♥ &micro;Torrent

DuckieTV automagically knows if either the &micro;Torrent or BitTorrent client is running on your pc and requests access to your torrents. If you grant access, DuckieTV shows you your download progress transparently directly on the calendar and you can start/stop and pause torrents with one click

Don't use &micro;Torrent? No problem. Feel free to use DuckieTV with any client of your preference. DuckieTV just launches a magnet link. You can also access the .torrent files if you need. 

Since DuckieTV v1.0 additional supported clients are Deluge, qBittorrent, Tixati, Transmission and Vuze.
Integration with other clients is planned for the future.
