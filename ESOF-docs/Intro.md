# Engineering Software

### Introduction, what we are all about

Hi!

We are a group of college students from Portugal, Porto studying Software Engineering in *Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto*.
The goal of one our classes is to study an Open-Source project and familiarize ourselves with its development process.
We chose your project because one of us uses it and we thought it would be interesting to document it.

What do you get:
* Hopefully professional documentation for your project.
* Critical reviews about the development process.
* And the most important, 2 new users to your software!

What do we get:
* 20 at this class (or not because of the exam) :D

We would like to start our work with you answering this question!

### What kind of Software Process Model have you followed to create DuckieTV?

1. **Waterfall Model**
	* In principle, a phase has to be complete before moving onto the next phase.
		* Requirements Definition (what is going to be created, what resources are needed, time line).
		* System and Software Design.
		* Implementation and Unit Testing.
		* Integration and System Testing.
		* Operation and Maintenance.

2. **Incremental Development and Delivery**
	* Develop the system in increments and evaluate each increment before proceeding to the development of the  next increment.
	* Evaluation done by the user.
	* Some of the increments can be deployed to end-users
	* Waterfall model can be followed (however you may divert from the phase's order).
	* Summing up, release ofter, release early.

	1. **Generic Incremental Development and Delivery**

	2. **Boehm's Spiral Model**
		* Process is represented as a spiral rather than as a sequence of activities with backtracking.
		* Focused on assessing and resolving risks in each loop.

	3. **Reuse-oriented Software Engineering**
		* Software modelling based on reusing existing systems.
			* Requirements Specification.
			* Component Analysis.
			* Requirements Modification.
			* System Design With Reuse.
			* Development and Integration.
			* System Validation.

	4. **Software Prototyping**
		* A prototype is an initial version of a system used to demonstrate concepts and try out design options.
			* Establish prototype objectives.
				* Prototyping plan.
			* Define Prototype Functionality.
				* Outline definition.
			* Develop Prototype.
				* Executable prototype.
			* Evalutate Prototype.
				* Evaluation report.
